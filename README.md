The NORVYA-M1 is a 4-channel EEG interface from scratch with analog filtering and digital amplification for neural signal capture. Implemented signal processing  for processing.
The goal of this project was meant to be completely low profile and self-sustaining, to eventually be used in the fields of prosthetics and robotics engineering, so that it can be applicable for robotic prosthetic joints, diagnosis machines, and as a Brain-Computer interface for desktop computers.

This is a really special project to me specifically, because I know many people who are disabled and go through much trouble because they don't have accsess to adequate medical care, or can't afford the huge cost
that is for technology like this. The cheapest EEG-Based BCI's that I know of are upwards of 2000 dollars, so I personally think around 100 bucks for that same opportunity is a huge improvement.

I also wanted to test just how far my electrical skills go. This is a huge jump for me and I honestly dont know how this project will turn out, but I am so happy that I was able to finish it, even if it doesnt end up
working out.
