The NORVYA-M1 is a 4-channel EEG interface from scratch with analog filtering and digital amplification for neural signal capture. Implemented signal processing  for processing.
The goal of this project was meant to be completely low profile and self-sustaining, to eventually be used in the fields of prosthetics and robotics engineering, so that it can be applicable for robotic prosthetic joints, diagnosis machines, and as a Brain-Computer interface for desktop computers.

It's a really special project of mine personally, and the first project ive done from complete start to finish.
